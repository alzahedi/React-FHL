Exercise
=========

Create a profile component named `Profile.tsx` that renders profile information about a person.
You can take this object as a sample for doing it. Concat first name and last name to create a full name and show it there. If image url is not passed show a placeholder image. You can use the blank-profile.jpg file in the public folder.

```typescript
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe'
  imageURL: 'https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg'
};
```
